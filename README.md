# Pands - Weekly - Tasks Repository

Welcome to the **PANDS Weekly Tasks** repository! This rep contains weekly assignments and exercises created as part of the Programming and Scripting module.

## Purpose
The repository is designed to:
- Help improve programming skills.
- Solve practical problems using Python.
- Demonstrate understanding of key programming concepts.

## Repository Structure includes
- Folders with a specific task solves 
- Python scripts implementing the solution.
- Supporting files, if required.

## Example weekly tasks include:
- Data analysis.
- File handling.
- Algorithm development.

## Topics Covered:
1. File Handling:

Weekly Tasks 07:
- Example: Weekly Tasks 07/es.py demonstrates reading from a file, checking file existence, and handling exceptions.
- User Input and Basic Arithmetic:

Weekly Tasks 02
- Example: Weekly Tasks 02/bank.py involves user input, arithmetic operations, and formatting output with the Euro symbol.
- Datetime and Weekday Calculations:

Weekly Tasks 05
- Example: Weekly Tasks 05/weekday.py uses the datetime module to determine if the current day is a weekday or weekend.
- Plotting and Data Visualization:

Weekly Tasks 08
- Example: Weekly Tasks 08/plottask.py demonstrates creating histograms and plots using matplotlib and numpy.
- Algorithm Implementation:

Weekly Tasks 04
- Example: Weekly Tasks 04/collatz.py implements the Collatz Conjecture algorithm with user input and iterative logic.
- Statistics and Random Data:

Weekly Tasks 08
- Example: Weekly Tasks 08/plottask.py includes generating and visualizing normal distributions with random data.

## Technologies Used
- **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**: A versatile, high-level programming language used for implementing all the weekly tasks in this project.

## Current Status
This repository is a work in progress, and new tasks are added weekly
